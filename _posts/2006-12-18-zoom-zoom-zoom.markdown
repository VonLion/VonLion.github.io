<img alt="89_9.JPG" src="http://blogs.hippo.nl/reijn/images/89_9.JPG" width="200" height="150" align="left"/><br/>Well this weekend I went on a wild chase for the <a href="http://www.canon-europe.com/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/EF_Lenses/Image_Stabilization_Lenses/EF_70-300mm_f4-5.6_IS_USM/index.asp?ComponentID=306158&SourcePageID=26369#1" target="_blank">Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM zoom lens</a>. I looked around on several pricewatch websites to get this lens as cheap as possible, but ended up with nothing after a Saturday cruising around Amsterdam. It seemed the lens was out of stock in every shop and they did not know when it would arrive at the store again, since Canon seemed to have had some delivery problems with this lens for the entire year.<br/><br/>I figured this would happen, especially at the end of the year, since the lens was one of the items in the cashback book coming with my Canon eos 350D. So back at home I was not giving up and called in Google. I ended up at the <a href="http://www.digitalwarehouse.nl/" target="_blank">DigitalWareHouse</a>, which was located in Haarlem. They did not have live stock on their webshop, so I just send them an email. Sunday afternoon I got a reply saying that they still had it in stock, so I reserved the lens I picked it up the same day. They guys at the DWH was very friendly and knew a lot about the lens. I would recommend the shop to everyone driving by Haarlem.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/reijnj/325357454/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/136/325357454_3338957ba2_m.jpg" width="240" height="176" alt="Blackbird in the garden" align="right"/></a> Here is one of my first shots. It's not that impressive, since it was taken behind glass and the light was very bad at the end of the day, as it was going to rain. The image is best viewed large, so you can see the details on the bird. The great thing about this lens is the Image Stabilizer. It's really great when you zoom in a lot. Any small movement is corrected by the IS. If you are thinking of buying a zoom lens: save the extra money for the IS lens, because it's really worth it!<br/><br/>Looking at the size of my camera with the lens attached I feel a bit like a paparazzi. :-)<br/><br/><br/><br/></div>
