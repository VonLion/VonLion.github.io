I guess I don't have to tell everybody how great <a href="http://getfirebug.com/" target="_blank">FireBug</a> is for Web Development, but I'm going to do it anyway. FireBug is so <em>easy</em> to use and so <em>feature-rich</em> that I think it's <strong>the best</strong> plugin available for FireFox. I think it's a must for every web developer these days and I can't image working without it, since I first started using it.<br/><br/>I've your not familiar with FireBug yet then <a href="http://www.ddj.com/dept/debug/196802787" target="_blank">here</a> is a good <a href="http://www.ddj.com/dept/debug/196802787" target="_blank">article</a> for you to read. In short: FireBug is an open source feature-rich web development plugin for FireFox. It has features like, debugging, profiling and javascript logging within your browser.<br/><br/>This month FireBug is more then a year old and has grown enormous over the past year. A couple of days ago version 1.0 came out and it's extremely stable. I use FireBug all the time while working on <a href="http://www.hippocms.org" target="_blank">Hippo CMS</a>, since it's full of Javascript and XMLHttpRequest calls and it helped me out a lot.<br/><br/>If you're not using <a href="http://getfirebug.com/" target="_blank">FireBug</a> yet, be sure to check it out and play with it for a while to get familiar with it.<br/><br/></div>
