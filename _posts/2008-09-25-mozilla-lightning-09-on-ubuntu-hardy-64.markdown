For those of you who are also running a 64-bit linux machine (like me) and want to use the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/releases/lightning0.9.html">Mozilla Lightning 0.9 Thunderbird add-on</a>, you can find the 64-bit version of this add-on <a href="http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/calendar/lightning/releases/0.9/contrib/linux-x86_64/lightning-0.9-linux-x86_64.xpi">here in the Mozilla release archive</a>. The one that comes from the add-on website doesn't seem to install unfortunately.<br/><br/>If you also want to push your calendar entries back to for instance <a href="http://calendar.google.com">Google Calender</a>, be sure to use the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/sunbird/addon/4631">Provider for Google Calendar add-on</a>. It allows bidirectional access to Google Calendar.<br/><br/><br/></div>
