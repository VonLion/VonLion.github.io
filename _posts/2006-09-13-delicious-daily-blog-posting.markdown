The other day I noticed a feature in <a href="http://del.icio.us/" target="_blank">del.icio.us</a> which allows you to post your interesting bookmarks through XML-RPC on to your weblog. I tried the service, but it said it failed to authenticate over and over again. So I rechecked the settings again and again, but still could not find the problem.<br/><br/>Well what's left to do? Of course I googled it and after a while I found my answer somewhere on the internet. Thanks to <a href="http://hownow.brownpau.com/archives/2006/02/delicious_daily_blog_posting_mt_32_api_login_issue/" target="_blank">Paulo</a>  I found out there was another password that needed to be set in MovableType before the posts were entered correctly into MT. The problem here was the MT API password, which you need to set separately from your regular username and password. You can find the password field in: "Main Menu > Authors > Yourself (where "Yourself" is you)."<br/><br/>From now on you can be expecting some interesting hyperlinks from day to day,<br/><br/></div>
