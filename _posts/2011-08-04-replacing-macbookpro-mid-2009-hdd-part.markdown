As you might have read in my <a href="http://blog.jeroenreijn.com/2011/06/macbook-pro-replacing-internal-hdd.html">previous upgrade post</a> I initially wanted to upgrade my MacBookPro5,4 mid 2009 model with an SSD. Since my initial search for a compatible SSD I've read tons of articles on the web describing this same issue, but without a solid answer. It's been quite a challenge to figure out what to do and I almost gave up on the idea of being able to use an SSD until I found the <a href="http://failedexe.com/2010/04/08/installing-a-ssd-in-a-macbook-pro-unibody">this excellent blogpost</a> by David Leach.<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hvdw4L9bgU0/Tjr767J8fZI/AAAAAAAAAfk/fhkJuUrBbW4/s1600/kingstonvplus100.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="140" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hvdw4L9bgU0/Tjr767J8fZI/AAAAAAAAAfk/fhkJuUrBbW4/s200/kingstonvplus100.jpg" width="200" /></a>I've read similar stories to that of David, where 5 attempts with different SSD's kept on failing and all of them gave them different kind of results from not recognizing the SSD to getting those colorful beachballs.<br /><br />Davids post and the people in his comments gave me the confidence to go for a <a href="http://www.kingston.com/ukroot/ssd/vplus100.asp?id=1">Kingston V+100 128 GB SSD</a> as it seemed to be the one and only drive that worked for him and other readers of his blog.<br /><br />So last week I ordered one and it arrived the next day! Since I had a day off I had plenty of time to install it. Only when you need to go from 250GB to 128GB you will notice how much 'noise' is on your laptop's hard drive. The 128GB version was already quite expensive and I thought that the 256 GB was not really worth it. A 256GB version is around â‚¬ 420,&nbsp; which is in my opinion a bit too much money for an upgrade. It's a fact that traditional HDD's are a lot cheaper than SSDs at the moment, but the performance upgrade is really worth it. <br /><br />Just after I cloned the original HDD to the SSD with <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a> I tried a cold start of the MBP with the original HDD installed. The bootup time was clocked at 1 minute and 19 seconds. That's quite long for a fresh start. Of course I don't restart all the time, but you get the initial idea. So after I replaced the HDD with the SSD I set the timer again and it really blew me away! The cold start with the SSD took only <b>21 seconds</b>! That's really amazing.<br /><br />Now for some actual real world test I fired up <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> with four projects open. IntelliJ was open within 30 seconds (with indexing) for four projects. AWESOME! How's that for a productivity boost.<br /><br /><h2>   Some benchmarks</h2><br />Now in my previous post I posted some benchmarks of the original stock Apple HDD vs the <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=140">WD Scorpio Blue</a> where there was only a very small improvement in overal read and write speeds.<br /><br />For those of you who did not read my other post here is the performance of the Scorpio Blue 5400 rpm drive.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EA6iKtlElvQ/TgeNobhbpSI/AAAAAAAAAdE/jOa410EkV5c/s1600/CapturFiles-201106177_1206.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="630" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EA6iKtlElvQ/TgeNobhbpSI/AAAAAAAAAdE/jOa410EkV5c/s640/CapturFiles-201106177_1206.png" width="640" /></a></div>That looks nice right? But here is the Kingston V+100 SSD benchmark. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SLPSwXFilvQ/TjsI3NcYvAI/AAAAAAAAAfo/fDrK4NROM_M/s1600/CapturFiles-201107209_1007.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="631" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SLPSwXFilvQ/TjsI3NcYvAI/AAAAAAAAAfo/fDrK4NROM_M/s640/CapturFiles-201107209_1007.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />As you can see the read and write speeds have greatly improved. The average read speed is now almost four times the previous speed, which you really notice when booting up or starting an application. I've been using the SSD now for over more than a week during my daily work. I can tell you: I will never go back! The laptop is really fast and responsive now as I would expect a laptop should be.<br /><br />I hope others struggling with their MacBookPro mid 2009 model will be able to find this post and get the most out of their MacBookPro. It's really worth the upgrade!</div>

Have you tried resetting your PRAM? http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1379. Perhaps that was your problem. Or it might be that it&#39;s just a faulty drive. Kingston guarantees that it should work, so you should also be able to contact their support.</div>

Hi Sander,<br /><br />sorry to hear your story. From my experience the OCZs won&#39;t work, so that will be a waste of time for the tech guys. I guess it&#39;s indeed your SATA controller. It might be that you have a defective SATA controller that does not know how to negotiate with the SATA controller in the macbook. If everything else fails you should try a SATA I drive, but I&#39;m not sure if you can still get those drives.<br /><br />What I also have used as a reference was http://eshop.macsales.com/MyOWC/ . It states a list of compatible drives for a specific macbook brand.<br /><br />Jeroen</div>

Hi Jeroen, I&#39;ve exactly the same model and bought the exact same drive based on your advice and other people on internet. Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t work for me. I&#39;ve tried just about anything for over a week, even doing a fresh install of both Snow Leopard and Lion.<br /><br />When booting the drive from an USB external closure it works fine but as soon as you put it in the mac itself and try to boot it behaves erratically (won&#39;t always boot and other strange undefined behaviour). When scanning the drive using the Disk Utility, it keeps saying that the filesystem is corrupt (while another scan when it was in the USB external closure said it was fine).<br /><br />Also tried to put my Kingston drive in a newer model Macbook Pro and that worked perfectly. I did put the drive of the newer Macbook Pro (which is the 256G version of the Kingston) into my macbook and that also failed. Appearently something about this type of drive that is biting the controller in my Macbook. I&#39;m going to let the guys at the Apple store put another drive (OCZ Vertex II or III) in. The ensured me that when it doesn&#39;t work I won&#39;t have to pay so that safe to try :).<br /><br />My final conclusion: when you have a Macbook Pro mid 2009; go to your apple store and let those guys take care of it. It will cost you slightly more but saves you potential a lot of trouble! If you have a iMac begin 2008 or a new Macbook pro than you can do it yourself (both positive experienced with it).<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Sander</div>
