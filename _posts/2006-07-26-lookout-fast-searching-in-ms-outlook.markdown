For all those Windows users out that still suffering with MS Outlook there is a free extension available that will boost your search result and give a result from your entire mailbox within seconds. It's called <a href="http://www.lookoutsoft.com/Lookout/about.html" target="_blank">Lookout</a> and it's quite old actually. Maybe some of you already heard about it, but I still wanted to mention it.<br/><br/>Lookout can search your messages, contacts, notes, etc and can be used in combination with Outlook 2000, Outlook XP and Outlook 2003, running on Windows 2000 or later. If you are in need of a fast search engine, go and check it out at their website. I noticed they are bought by Microsoft now, but the product still remains downloadable through their <a href="http://www.lookoutsoft.com/Lookout/about.html" target="_blank">website</a>.<br/><br/><br/></div>
