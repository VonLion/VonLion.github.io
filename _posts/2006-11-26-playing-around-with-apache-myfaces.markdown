<div class='post'>
I've been playing around with <a href="http://myfaces.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Myfaces</a> since a couple of days, after Wander created a <a href="http://svn.hippocms.org/repos/hippo/hippo-samples/jsf-repository-browser/" target="_blank">front-end</a> for Hippo Repository with MyFaces. After looking at this prototype I got the urge to try myfaces out myself and get to know something about it.<br/><br/>The first thing I stumbled upon was how do I get started? The <a href="http://myfaces.apache.org/gettingstarted.html" target="_blank">getting started</a> page is not very clear about this, except that you need some certain packages.<br/><br/>Next step of couse was to move on to the MyFaces Wiki. The Wiki had exactly what I was looking for. A clean and simple <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/myfaces/MyFaces_Archetypes_for_Maven" target="_blank">maven 2 getting started page</a>. It allowd me to create a simple webapp within 5 minutes after installing maven 2.<br/><br/>So now it's time to experiment some more. Let's see what kind of fun stuff is possible with MyFaces!<br/><br/></div>
