I'm currently on my way from Amsterdam to Brussels together with Berry. Getting up early is not one of my favorite things, but getting there by train is so much more relaxing then by car, which I did last time. I'll be visiting <a href="http://www.smals-mvm.be/site_nl/home.html" target="_blank">Smals</a> for the next two days.<br/><br/>We'll be helping them out and keeping the big <a href="http://www.hippocms.org" target="_blank">Hippo</a> under control.<br/><br/></div>
