Yesterday I faced the storm to go buy my new portrait lens. I bought the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=152&modelid=7306">Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II</a> for only 89 euro's, which I've heard a lot of good stories about. It's one of the cheapest Canon lenses, but the image quality seems to be a lot better then the default kit lens.<br/><br/>Since the store was closed between 6 and 7, I had to walk around facing the heavy storm. I wished I had my camera with me, because the wind made some exceptional scenes. People almost flying by and trees trying to keep standing in the heavy wind.<br/><br/>That made me come up with the idea of doing photography during the ApacheCon. I know that there are a couple Apache people that like their camera's and love taking pictures, looking at the pictures of Arje and Andrew when they were at the ApacheCon in Austin Texas and my experience with the Cocoon GT. I guess it would be cool if we could do something similar in Amsterdam during the <a href="http://www.apachecon.com/2007/EU/index.html/e=MjAwNy9FVQ">ApacheCon Europe</a>.<br/><br/>I wonder if there would be any interest in that..<br/><br/></div>
