<p>I've been too busy lately, to do all the things that I want to do for a while. Since my <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org" target="_blank">Cocoon</a> comittership I wanted to give Cocoon 2.2 a go and see all the shiny new things and help out, but somehow I'm unable to find some descent time.</p><br/><p><br/>With the ApacheCon coming up Jasha and I also still need to finish our demo application, but first we have to get started.<br/></p><br/><p>I'm also doing some work for Hippo Repository during my evening time.I'm afraid I need more hours in a week. :-( </p><br/><br/><br/></div>
