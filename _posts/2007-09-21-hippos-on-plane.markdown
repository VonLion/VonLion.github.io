This tuesday for instance I went to the UK together with Wouter for a meeting at a customer. I always love traveling (except if there are any delays of course).<br/></p><br/><p> The past couple of months I've been working on several different projects in different cities in and outside of Netherlands. That's when I came up with the idea to show you guys where my work brings me, so I packed my tiny digital camera to bring along on this trip I took for my company. To do it in Hippo style I brought a tiny Hippo along as well, which we ordered a while ago for the ApacheCon EU 2007. Unfortunately the Hippos came in too late and we were stuck with a couple of hundred Hippos, but I'm happy too see that all our customers love the tiny little creatures.<br/></p><br/><p>This tuesday it was a bit rainy here in the Netherlands so I was a bit disappointed that I could not take so many outside photos, but here is one from the plane while flying above the UK. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/reijnj/1416075123/" title="Photo Sharing"><br/><img style="width: 475px; height: 357px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1253/1416075123_da493de197.jpg" alt="More Hippos on a plane" align="middle" border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></a><br/></p><br/><br/></div>
