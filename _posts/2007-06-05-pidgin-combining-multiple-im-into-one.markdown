<p>Today I switched from having multiple IM (Instant Messaging) clients open at the same time to only one on my Windows XP desktop. <a title="Pidgin" target="_blank" href="http://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a> (formerly known as Gaim) has all the IM protocols I need to talk with my friends and co-workers. It's an open source application that runs on multiple platforms. The past 2 years I was very happy with <a title="Trillian Basic" target="_blank" href="http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/">Trillian Basic</a>, but when Google introduced it's <a title="GoogleTalk" target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/talk/">GoogleTalk</a> I was back at having multiple clients. Pidgin has now solved this for me.<br/></p><br/><p><a href="http://www.adiumx.com/" target="_blank">Adium</a> has been able to do this for a while, but I was not able to find a suitable Windows client untill now.</p><br/><p>I've been working with it for a full day now and I'm very happy with it. It saves me system resources, runs on multiple platforms and the great things is that you can even combine multiple accounts of the same protocol. If you're looking for a new IM client that combines multiple protocols, be sure to take a look at <a title="Pidgin" target="_blank" href="http://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>.<br/></p><br/><br/></div>
