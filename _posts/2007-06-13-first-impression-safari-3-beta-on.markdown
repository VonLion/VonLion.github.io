<p>Yesterday Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/06/11safari.html" target="_blank">introduced</a> Safari 3 beta for the Windows platform. Of course as a developer I had to check it out and see what it gave me.</p><br/><p>The installation was a success, so I had a positive start and my first page impression was very good. I like what Safari does with the font and page rendering. The page looks just a bit smoother then for instance in FireFox and Internet Explorer.</p><br/><p>After having worked with Safari for a day I can say that most websites work like a charm under Safari, but this morning I noticed some strange behavior from this beta version. One of the problems I noticed was that when I minimize or maximize the browser on my dual screen desktop, the browser disappears somewhere on the right side of my screen. I'm then unable to get the browser back and I have to close it from the Windows task manager and relaunch the browser.<br/></p><br/><p>While trying to write a blogpost this morning I also noticed some strange behavior with the clipboard and with submitting forms from Safari. Somehow only a part of my blogpost got posted and ended up in the database.<br/></p><br/><p>I'm not sure if Apple should have released this beta version yet, since it has some weird behavior in very basic functionalities. I've also heard that for some people the browser crashes occasionally. For now Safari will not be able to start a new browser war. Let's see what the next update will bring us!</p><br/><br/></div>
