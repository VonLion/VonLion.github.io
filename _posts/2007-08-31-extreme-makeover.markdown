<div class='post'>
I kind of had it with the skin of this weblog. I've been looking for a good skin for ages, but it seems hard to get (at least for movabletype). I'm going to redesign the hole thing. I'm trying to discover what makes MovableType run and how easily you can change your entire webpage.<br/><br/>I've been wanting to change the CSS and HTML for a while, but the HTML is horrible and it's really killing me.  That made me decide to change everything. It's one of those cases where it's best to go back to the drawing board, so that's exactly what I'm doing.<br/><br/>I guess you'll see the changes over the next week.<br/><br/></div>
