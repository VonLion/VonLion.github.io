As of yesterday <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/" target="_blank">Google WebToolkit</a> (GWT 1.3 Release Candidate) is 100% Open Source and Apache 2.0 licensed. This is a great step for GWT and for web developers around the world.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Since our primary mission is to help users (as opposed to hoarding proprietary development tools), opening up GWT has always been a no-brainer -- we just had to decide when. Now that GWT has some serious adoption and a lively user community, open-sourcing is the obvious next step to help GWT evolve more quickly. </blockquote><br/><br/>We've been playing around with GWT here at Hippo to get some insight on the toolkit for Hippo CMS 7. We haven't decided yet on what framework will power Hippo CMS 7, but Google's decision makes it more interesting.<br/><br/></div>
