It's been all over the blogosphere! As far as I can see, you could not have missed that <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> has announced it's own open source browser called <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>.<br/><br/>In the past there have been a lot of rumors about a Google browser, but now they made it <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/fresh-take-on-browser.html">official</a>. They even created a nice <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/">comic</a> about it, to explain all features and concept of the new browser.<br/><br/>Google Chrome looks really promising, but I'm afraid that for us developers it's going to be just another browser to test our web applications against. With the current diversity within the browser market it's already a pain to keep up with all the available browsers. Therefor I think it's a good thing that they did not decide to create their own browser engine, but instead are using the <a href="http://webkit.org/">webkit</a> engine, which is also used in Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>.<br/><br/>Too bad they are releasing the beta on Windows first, because I would have loved to give it a go on Ubuntu!<br/><br/></div>
