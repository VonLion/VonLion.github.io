The last time I went to Artis was probably about 15-20 years ago. It did not change much, but spending a day with exotic creatures is always fun. The weather was great and we shared lots of great photo moments. The photo above is just one in a series of photos taken this day. If you want to see more, I would recommend you take a look at my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/reijnj/sets/72157623964594333/show/">set</a> on Flickr.</div>
