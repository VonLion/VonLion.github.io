My <a href="http://www.samsung.com/nl/products/mobilephones/mobilephones/sgh_d500.asp" target="_blank">Samsung D500</a> served me well over the past year, but I was in search of a new phone. After playing with a smartphone at work, I was fully hooked. Luckily I was able to pick a new phone, because my subscription ended in august last year.<br /><br />I went for the Sony Ericsson <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=us&amp;lc=en&amp;ver=4000&amp;template=pip1&amp;zone=pp&amp;pid=10385" target="_blank">m600i</a>, which looked to me like a good replacement and one of the smaller smartphones available. So I've sent in my order and the phone appeared after a couple of days. I've been playing with it for a while now and I really like it! It has a lot of great features like: Push email, UMTS, Flight mode, Opera and it even supports SVG.<br /><br />One of the big pains is getting your contacts over to the new phone, since they were not stored on my SIM. This seems to be a big issue with every new phone I get. I got my Samsung working after spending a day on it connecting through bluetooth with my office Dell laptop. So you would expect it would be fairly easy when installing the SE software some years later, but even with the USB cable it was a real pain in the ass. After spending halve a day on getting bluetooth and the USB cable to work I switched to my desktop and the USB cable worked instantly. So for now I'm fine, but I have to get this stupid thing working with my Dell laptop, since I don't want to plug in the cable all the time.<br /><br />But after a week I still really like the phone. Standby time is fine and I haven't explored even 50% of the features.<br /><br /></div>
