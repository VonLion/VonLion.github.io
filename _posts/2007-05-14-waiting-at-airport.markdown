<p>So here I am at Schiphol airport waiting for my flight to London. This afternoon I had a feeling, that it was going to be a long day. And it seems I was right. Entering the big hall it was the first thing I noticed: the big red letters around my departure time. It seems I have a 40 minutes delay, but as you know it's just an indication. It's only 40 minutes you might say, but waiting for 40 minutes can be quite a long time.</p><br/><br/><p>I can still remember the day (about 2 years) ago that <a href="http://blogs.hippo.nl/arje/" target="_blank">Arje</a> and I went to London and they started out with an hour delay and it ended in not going at all, because of the weather.  Let's hope that the delay today is not because of the weather, otherwise it can become an ever longer night then expected.<br/></p><br/><br/><p>I always read other peoples weblog, where they complain about flying specific airlines. Untill now I did not really understand what all the fuzz was about. I guess the amount of frustration can be measured by how many flights you have a year and the reason why you're at the airport. I can't remember being frustrated about a delay while going on vacation, but today it seems to bother me a lot more.</p><br/><br/><p>Well I'm off for a nice cold heineken. Maybe that will bring me in a better mood ;-)</p><br/><br/></div>
