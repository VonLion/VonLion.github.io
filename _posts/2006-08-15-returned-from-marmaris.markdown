Turkye is a beautifull country with some great culture and an interesting history. The temperature was really nice with an average of 33 C and we had a full week of sunshine.<br/><br/>My main goal was to relax as much as possible, since I've been extremely busy at the office for the past 6 months. I can actually say that I got some real rest. I loved reading a book outside in the sun and taking an occasional dive in the pool. It was great having no computer around. Just me and my girlfriend and some piece and quiet.
