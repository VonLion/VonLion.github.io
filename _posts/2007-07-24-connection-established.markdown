<div class='post'>
<p>I'm sitting on my new couch right now, while writing this small blogpost. It seems the internet connection in my new apartment has been established :D . I'm waiting for the delivery guys that are supposed to bring me my new tv, washing machine and fridge.</p><br/><p>My past two weeks of vacation have been not like any vacation I had before. I guess it has been even more exhausting then partying for two weeks long. A lot of work has been done these two weeks. With some help of friends and family all the walls, floors are now done and our couches have been delivered.</p><br/><p>Now we just have to wait for all the other furniture to be delivered. Most of it will be delivered this week, but we still have to wait for our bed before we can actually move in. Let's hope they make some haste because I can't wait!</p><br/><br/></div>
