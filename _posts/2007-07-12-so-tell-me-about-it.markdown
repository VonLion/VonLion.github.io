<p>Tonight I went to see <a href="http://www.jossstone.com/" target="_blank">Joss Stone</a> performing live at the Heineken Music Hall. One of my friends had arranged the tickets a couple of months ago, before the concert was sold out. The HMH was fully packed and the mood was set. It was going to be a very good night.</p><br/><p>The opener of the night was an unknown band to me and will remain that way since I could not figure out their name because of their British accents. They made an interesting sounds of music, but not something I would like to listen too while working or something.</p><br/><p>Around 9 pm Joss Stone came on stage. She was walking bare footed on stage in this very nice dress ;-). Since I'm not a dedicated fan, this was the first time that I noticed she was running around bare footed while performing live. Soraya was able to tell me that she was doing this more often. I guess I don't watch enough TV these days.</p><br/><p>As usual the sound in the HMH was amazing. It was 5 years ago that I last visited the HMH, but it was still as good or maybe even better. It's said that the HMH has Europe's best sounds when it gets to live performances. I'm not an expert, but it was really really good.</p><br/><p>She sang a lot of songs from her old album and only a few new ones as far as I noticed. I've listened to "Introducing Joss Stone" a few times and did not recognize a lot of songs. We had a really good time tonight and the show was amazing.I definitely want to go and see her next time when she's performing in Amsterdam.</p><br/><p>ps.
